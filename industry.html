              </div>
            </div>

			<p><b>Abstract:</b> IT companies around the globe are building large-scale cloud systems to meet the demands of an increasing number of cloud computing services. These cloud systems, however, can be brought down to their knees, by a large number, sometimes high profile, incidents. These incidents reduce cloud system availability and cost companies’ money, brand reputation, and team moral.<br/> 
			In this talk, I will present my on-going journey of building highly-available cloud systems, from measurement and monitoring, to failure localization and understanding, and to automatic mitigation and intervene. The goal of this journey is to build highly-available systems that recover from failures when they happen, and that avoid avoidable failures by learning from the past. </p>

              </div>
            </div>

			<p><b>Abstract:</b> Current wisdom of building cloud-scale data center networks is host SDN philosophy, i.e., design to scale out by distributing billions of SDN policies (e.g., VPC overlay, security group, ACL, SLB and NAT) to millions of end hosts. However, with fast increase of NIC speed and SDN policies, and unfortunately with slow increase of CPU performance, pure software based host SDN stack won't be able to keep up very soon. In the coming post Moore's Law world, specialization/hardware acceleration seems to be the only way left to close the gap between host SDN performance and NIC speed in the long run.<br/>
			In this talk, I will present Tencent's practice about network acceleration based on SmartNIC. Specifically, I will explain SmartNIC motivation, use cases in both bare metal and public clouds, and our vision to converge the SmartNIC architecture for bare metal and public clouds in the future. In the end, I will share our experience of building hardware from scratch in Internet company like Tencent.</p>
			
			<p><b>Speaker Bio:</b> Layong (Larry) Luo is an expert engineer in Tencent, leading the SmartNIC project and cloud network planning in the network platform department of TEG. Prior to joining Tencent, he was a senior software engineer and tech lead in Microsoft Azure Networking, working on SmartNIC based network acceleration. Before that, he was a network researcher in Microsoft Research Asia, with research focus on data center networks, middlebox/NFV as a service, RDMA, FPGA OS, and SmartNIC. Larry obtained his Ph.D. in computer architecture from Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Science, and his Ph.D. research was all about hardware accelerated network systems.  Larry values hands-on experience as much as research vision. He has not only published many research papers in top-tier network conferences such as SIGCOMM, INFOCOM, CoNEXT, and ATC, but also built a lot of high-performance network systems from hardware (schematic design, PCB layout, board manufacturing, and FPGA design) to software (driver, kernel network stack and application).</p>

              </div>
            </div>

			<p><b>Abstract:</b> Fixed Network Functions are rapidly transitioning from discrete appliances into Virtual Network Functions, this is driving the need to more efficiently consolidate compute, storage and communications workloads on a general purpose server platform. This presentation reviews advancements made in CPU and platform technology that enable developers to efficiently migrate communications workloads from discrete appliances to standard server platforms. Intel’s skylake microarchitecture and I/O subsystems will be reviewed from a packet processing perspective. We will also review new functionality that has been added to the DataPlane Development  Kit in order to truly unlock the packet processing capabilities of the platform.</p>
			
			<p><b>Speaker Bio:</b> Intel NPG platform solution architect for DPDK (classified as a kernel bypass technology). He has being worked on packet processing over 13 years, lots of experience on doing data plane on different system architecture(e.g. ASIC, FPGA, NPU and CPU). He spends years on DPDK to optimize high performance network I/O and its virtualization(including para-virtualization and SR-IOV) towards NFV. One of the recent work is to figure out next-gen NFV grade virtual host interfaces which can well balance the performance and cloudification.</p>
