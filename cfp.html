			<p>The Second Asia-Pacific Workshop on Networking (APNetâ€™18) aims to bring together the very best researchers in computer networking and systems across the Asia-Pacific region and the global community to a live forum discussing and debating innovative ideas at their early stages. The mission of APNet is that promising but not-yet-mature ideas can receive timely feedback from experienced researchers, shaping them into major conferences such as SIGCOMM, NSDI, SOSP, OSDI, MobiCom, CoNEXT and so on.</p>
			
			<p>We invite submissions of short papers (up to 6 pages, including references) on a wide range of networking research, including, but not limited to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Network architectures and algorithms</li>
				<li>Cloud and wide-area networking systems &amp; infrastructure</li>
				<li>Networking support for applications</li>
				<li>Operating system support for networking</li>
				<li>Kernel-bypass and RDMA networking and applications</li>
				<li>Enterprise, datacenter, and storage area networks</li>
				<li>SDN, NFV, and network programming</li>
				<li>Networking hardware design</li>
				<li>Network measurement, monitoring, diagnosis, and operations</li>
				<li>Formal methods and network verification</li>
				<li>Network security and privacy, censorship, transparency</li>
				<li>Network, transport, and application-layer protocols</li>
				<li>Resource management, QoS, and signaling</li>
				<li>Routing, traffic engineering, switching, and addressing</li>		
				<li>Wireless, mobile, and sensor networking</li>
			</ul>

			<p>The APNet Program Committee will select papers based on novelty, significance, and technical merit, rather than completeness. Innovative well-reasoned ideas with preliminary evaluations will suffice for APNet. Accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library. We hope that the extension of APNet papers, when substantiated by solid implementation and experimentation, can be published at the aforementioned premier conferences.</p>
			
			<h1>Submission Instructions</h1>
			<p><b><a href="https://apnet2018.hotcrp.com">https://apnet2018.hotcrp.com</a> is open for registration and submission.</b></p>
			
			<p>Submissions must be no longer than 6 pages (10 point font, 12 point leading, 7 inch by 9.25 inch text block) including all content and references. You can find a .zip file <a href="apnet18.zip">here</a> with the necessary LaTeX files to create a template, as well as the compiled pdf. All submissions must be double-blind: submissions must not indicate the names or affiliations of the authors in the paper. Only electronic submissions in PDF will be accepted. Submissions must be written in English, render without error using standard tools (e.g., Acrobat Reader), and print on US Letter paper. Papers must contain novel ideas and must differ significantly in content from previously published papers and papers under simultaneous submission (e.g., the extension of APNet submission with complete implementation/experiments may be submitted simultaneously elsewhere).</p>

			<p>Please note any change in title or authorship must be <b>APPROVED BY the PC CHAIRS</b>. This is to ensure that our publication accurately reflects any updates.</p>
			
			<p>The page limit for the final paper is 6 pages + 1 page references = 7 pages. For the final paper, please use the <a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">official ACM Article template</a>, but make sure to use 10 pt font. Note the default is 9 pt in the new template. So you need to change the font size. Please do NOT use copies of these templates that you might find elsewhere since we cannot be sure that those are compliant.</p>
			
			<p>As described on the above template webpage, the authors should provide proper indexing information in the final version according to the ACM Computing Classification System (CCS). More information about the ACM CCS is available at <a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/class-2012">ACM CCS website</a>.</p>

			<p>The authors must insert the correct rights management text and bibliographic strip into the final paper. The ACM will use its automated system to email this information to the authors. Please set your email spam settings to allow messages from "rightsreview@acm.org". <b>For papers that are conditionally accepted with shepherding, the copyright forms will be available after the shepherding outcome</b>.</p>
			
			<p>If you have any questions about the camera-ready process, feel free to contact APNet 2018 publication chair <a href="https://henryhxu.github.io">Hong Xu</a>.</p>
